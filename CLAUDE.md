## TL;DR for agents

- **PRIMARY FOCUS (2026-06):** the repo's #1 priority is **publishing work that drives
  forward an EMC treatment**. As of 2026-06-25 the **lead publication vehicle is the split-out,
  target-centric NR4A3-degrader result paper** — **[research/manuscripts/nr4a3-degrader-paper.md](./research/manuscripts/nr4a3-degrader-paper.md)**
  (EMC is its lead clinical application among several NR4A3/NR4A indications); the
  **[research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-roadmap.md](./research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-roadmap.md)**
  remains the EMC-program paper. This serves, not replaces, the EMC goal (see
  **[research/manuscripts/nr4a3-degrader-paper-positioning.md](./research/manuscripts/nr4a3-degrader-paper-positioning.md)**).
  **Resuming the degrader in-silico work (program state + exactly how to run the next GPU step, e.g. the
  warhead screen): [research/modalities/nr4a3-degrader-next-steps.md](./research/modalities/nr4a3-degrader-next-steps.md)** —
  as of 2026-06-26 the cryptic-pocket druggability case is complete (all gates pass) and the next step is
  the built-but-idle selective-warhead screen.
  The crux of the portfolio is still **[research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-strategy.md](./research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-strategy.md)**
  and the board in **[research/IDEAS.md](./research/IDEAS.md)**. **No wet lab is available**, so every
  "next step" must be either (1) publish-to-convince or (2) in-silico evaluation — never a wet-lab to-do.
- **What (now shelved):** a zero-build static site of one-page-per-rare-cancer information
  hubs (first page: EMC). The patient-facing UI is **deprioritized/shelved** — keep it
  working if touched, but don't invest new effort there without being asked.
- **Golden rule:** never fabricate medical facts, stats, citations, or patient
  data. Everything clinical must be cited. Non-real registry data must be
  flagged `SAMPLE_SYNTHETIC` and bannered. See AGENTS.md → "medical integrity".
- **Citing & combining studies:** registry data uses a structured citation map
  (`registry.citations` + `sourceId`/`primaryRef`, primary vs secondary) and a
  fixed pooling method (crude denominator-weighted proportions + Wilson 95% CIs,
  non-overlapping cohorts only). Read **[METHODOLOGY.md](./METHODOLOGY.md)** before
  touching `registry`.
- **To add a cancer:** `node scripts/new-cancer.mjs <slug> "Name" "ABBR" "Category"`,
  then fill `data/cancers/<slug>.json` (the EMC file is the worked example).
- **A cancer page = one JSON file.** You rarely touch HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Before committing:** `node scripts/validate.mjs` must pass.
- **No dependencies, no build step.** Keep it that way.
- **Deploy:** GitHub Pages (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) on push to `main`;
  keep all URLs relative.
- **EMC treatment-discovery track (research, not the site):** the prioritized
  portfolio is **[research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-strategy.md](./research/manuscripts/emc-treatment-strategy.md)**
  (capstone ranking of every route); every active/shelved idea + next step is on the
  "route status board" in **[research/IDEAS.md](./research/IDEAS.md)**.
  **Read those before resuming any treatment-research work** so you don't
  re-litigate settled decisions (e.g. the synth-lethal/BRD9 route was downgraded
  by a DepMap transfer-prior result; the vaccine/HLA-coverage paper is parked).
