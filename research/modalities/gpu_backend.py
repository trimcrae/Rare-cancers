"""
Provider-agnostic GPU compute backend for the NR4A3 MD/FEP jobs — so the SAME checkpointed job runs on AWS
SageMaker, RunPod, Vast.ai, or an HPC Slurm queue (ACCESS) without rewriting the science, and we can send work
to whichever is cheapest.

THE #1 GOTCHA THIS SOLVES (trimcrae, 2026-07-12): on rented-GPU providers (RunPod/Vast) you keep paying until
the instance is EXPLICITLY destroyed — a job that finishes but leaves its pod up bleeds money on an idle GPU.
SageMaker hides this (auto-releases on exit); a provider-agnostic harness must guarantee it. So every backend
exposes `self_terminate_cmd()` — the command the running job executes to destroy ITS OWN instance — and
`autoteardown.run_with_teardown` runs it in a finally-block + a watchdog, so the GPU is released on completion,
failure, OR timeout, on every provider. Managed backends (SageMaker, Slurm) return an empty command because the
platform already auto-releases.

Design goals: (1) per-unit checkpoint/resume to a provider-agnostic object store (already how our jobs work, so
a flaky-but-cheap marketplace is safe); (2) no idle GPUs anywhere; (3) pick-the-cheapest routing. The core +
MockBackend are pure-stdlib and unit-tested; the real adapters guard on missing SDK/creds so they fail loudly
off-provider rather than silently.

    The guard is a VM that deletes ITSELF at job end: `gcloud compute instances delete <name> --zone <zone>`.
    Name+zone come from the instance metadata server; a startup script exports them as GCP_INSTANCE_NAME/GCP_ZONE
    so this static argv resolves. Auth is a SERVICE-ACCOUNT JSON key (NOT a Gemini/AI-Studio API key — a
    different product) via GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS. Two real catches (documented in cheap-gpu-plan.md):
    (1) new accounts have GPU quota = 0 and Google blocks GPU-quota grants while on the free trial, so you must
    upgrade to a paid (still credit-funded) account and request quota before any GPU VM launches; (2) use SPOT
    (preemptible) VMs for the price in _CAPS — our per-unit checkpointing makes preemption safe. Best fit: the
    $300 credit is the reserve for the few long terminal MD legs where L4/A100 pricing beats Modal's serverless
